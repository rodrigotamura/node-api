# Description
This is my very first Node.js API using Express for learning purpose.

There are some explanations in `tutorials` folder and many comments within each script file (sorry, but only in portuguese ðŸ˜¢).

To run this app property you need:
- Node.js;
- MongoDB server (in this project I've used Docker).
